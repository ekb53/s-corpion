<h1>S-Corpion - Tax SaaS for S-Corp Owners</h1>
It's time to put TurboTax, Quickbooks, and Xero into the Recycle Bin. And then, empty it.

I'm building a web app hyper-focused on small business owners. 

Check out the initial features:
- Custom PDF Report Generation ~ Craft audit-proof salary estimation documents using BLS data and AI
- Create & Save Compensation Templates ~ Archive business reports, allowing for multiple documents year-round
- Manage Business Roles within your company ~ See up-to-date wage and occupation data for all of your roles you assume
- Tax Compliance Tracking ~ Visualize how your business stands with the IRS
- ...and much more
